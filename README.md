AI Ethics: Study materials I compiled for this GT maters course

Course Description:
"Abuse of big data means your worst fears can come true. Being monitored by your employer? Check. Government intrusions into your daily life? Check. Being turned down by college admissions because you are predicted to not donate in 10-20 years? Check. Sounds a bit like the visions in the Minority Report? Alas, machine learning algorithms are already being deployed by industry, government, and yes, even schools to make decisions that impact us in direct ways. Such programs are typically promoted as fair and free of human biases; but humans, humans that make mistakes, are programming, calibrating, and evaluating their performance. Thus resides the problem. How do we therefore design algorithms that effectively deal with the large amounts of data that are used to train them, while ensuring their outcomes aren't, well, misused. In this course, not only will we examine various AI/ML techniques that can be used to counterbalance the potential abuse and misuse of learning from big data, but we will focus on the effects of these technologies on individuals, organizations, and society, paying close attention to what our responsibilities are as computing professionals."
